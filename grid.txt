object oriented?
framework?

visualisation
	table?
	absolutely positioned images/divs?
	svg?
	canvas?
	color coding by player?

data structure
	"2d" array of numbers, each number being a bit field for its 8 directions (2*reduntant but allows for efficient lookup)
	Separate array of moves? (to allow replay, undo, etc [perhaps for drawing as well])
	playing field as object?

basic logic (rules)
	validate requested move
	carry out move if valid
	preview move (valid/invalid) on mouse-over

ai
	chess-like, recursive? A*?
